## Project Overview 📚🔍🏆

The project contains an analysis of IPL matches data. Here are some of the key aspects of the analysis:

- The number of wins by each team 🏆📈
- The frequency of each toss decision 🌟🔀
- The number of matches played in each city 🌆🏏
- The outcome of the toss and its impact on the match result 🔀📈🔍
- The details of the final match of each season 🏆📊
- The correlation between different columns of the data 📊🔍🧮

## Code Summary 📝💻📊

The code starts by importing the necessary Python libraries and the IPL matches dataset. It then performs various operations on the data such as filtering, sorting, aggregating, and visualizing. Some of the key operations include:

- Counting the number of wins by each team 📊🏆
- Plotting the frequency of each 'toss_decision' as a pie chart 📈🔀📊
- Plotting the 'win_by_runs' as a histogram 📈🔍📊
- Counting the frequency of each team appearing in 'team1' and 'team2' 📈🔢🏏
- Removing duplicate rows based on 'city' and 'season' 📊🔀🧹
- Displaying the 'season' and 'winner' of the last match of each season 📆🏆📊
- Displaying the correlation matrix of the dataframe 📈🔍📊
