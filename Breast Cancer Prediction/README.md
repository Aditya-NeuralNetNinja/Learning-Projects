This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates how to use sklearn's SGD Classifier and Polynomial Regression to classify the Breast Cancer dataset. 🐍🧪📚

## Description 📝📋

The script imports the Breast Cancer dataset from sklearn's datasets,
preprocesses the data, splits it into training and testing datasets,
trains the SGD classifier and Polynomial regression models, makes
predictions, and calculates recall scores. 📊🧪💻

The Breast Cancer dataset contains 569 instances with 30 features each.
The target variable contains the class labels 'malignant' or 'benign'. 📚📊🧬

### Dependencies 📦🔗

-   Python 3.7 🐍
-   Numpy 🧮
-   Pandas 🐼
-   Sklearn 🧪

### Executing program ▶️🔥

-   Run the script in Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, or any Python environment. 🖥️🐍

## Usage 📌🔑

The main parts of the script include:

1.  Importing necessary libraries and the dataset.
2.  Loading and exploring the data.
3.  Preprocessing the data: Scaling the data with Standard Scaler.
4.  Splitting the data into a training set and a test set.
5.  Training the SGD Classifier and making predictions.
6.  Evaluating the model using the recall score.
7.  Using Polynomial regression as another method for classification. 🧪📊📈

Please note that when running the script, some warnings might be raised due to data shape mismatches. These warnings are handled within the script and do not impact the functioning of the models. ⚠️🔧
